# King Courier
## Java E2E encryption messenger service.      
Welcome to King Courier messenger. This project is has been made to make a highly usable CLI (and possibly an electron client in the future!) E2E encryption messenger. The primary purpose of this project is to use 
different Java libraries and to create a project that uses my three favourite Computer Science topics: Cybersecurity / cryptography, Web APIs and concurrent programming (when useful).
This project doesn't use passwords for accounts but rather a userfile to authenticate. All chats will be stored locally. Basic Diffieâ€“Hellman will used for end to end communication but 
the encryption will be worked on as this project matures. This project is still in very early days.
